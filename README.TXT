RULES OF THE GAME :
The player has a minimum number of package to deliver/steal in the given time. 

The principle is as follows : the ants live in an underground world. We can be a delivery or a thief. If she is  a "postman" and has to bring parcels into houses (the human world), which are in the higher world. She therefore sails from house to house through the underground world. She has to deliver a number of packages in a limited time. 
Another ants, known as a "thief", takes the parcels that have been left in the houses, in the same way of the delivery ant. 

Possible game-over :
Ant Thief : Losing all life points (hit by the delivery ant or crushed by a human)
Ant Delivery : losing all of her honor points (lose honor when a package is stolen or crushed by a human).
